 
The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input.
The program must sort the alphabets in the string S based on the frequency 
(i.e., the number of occurrences) of the alphabets in descending order. If more than one alphabets have the same frequency,
the program must sort those alphabets in alphabetical order. Finally, the program must print the modified string as the output. 
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000  
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S. 
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
aaajjbbbcccc 
Output: 
ccccaaabbbjj 
Explanation: Here the string is aaajjbbbcccc. The frequency of a is 3. The frequency of j is 2. The frequency of b is 3. The frequency of c is 4. After sorting the alphabets in the string aaajjbbbcccc based on frequency, the string becomes ccccaaabbbjj. 
Example Input/Output 2: 
Input:
skillrack 
Output: 
kkllacirs  
Example Input/Output 3: 
Input: aaaBBBcCdddd
Output: ddddBBBaaaCc
