The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must enclose the consecutive consonants in the string S within the square brackets (possibly 1 consonant). Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. If there is no consonant in the string S, the program must print the same string as it is.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack

Output:
[sk]i[llr]a[ck]

Explanation:
The consecutive consonants in the string skillrack are sk, llr and ck.
So they are enclosed within the square brackets.
Hence the output is [sk]i[llr]a[ck]

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
CardGames

Output:
[C]a[rdG]a[m]e[s]

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
