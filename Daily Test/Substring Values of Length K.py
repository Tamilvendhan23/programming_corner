The program must accept a string S and an integer K as the input. The program must print all the substring values of length K in S as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S and K separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains all the substring values of length K in S separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
apple 3
Output:
app ppl ple
Explanation:
Here K = 3, all the substring values of length 3 in the string apple are app ppl ple.
Hence the output is app ppl ple
