A table called virus is created with the following DDL command:

create table virus (id int, name varchar(30), totaldeaths int);
Write the Java code using JDBC APIs to select the id, name and totaldeaths from the table virus whose totaldeaths is greater than 10000.

Note:
The order of the columns in the result set must be id, name and totaldeaths.
The result set must be ordered by the column name in alphabetical order.

IMPORTANT:
1. Place your code inside the execute method. You need not code/implement the main method.
2. DO NOT close the Database Connection conn in your code.
