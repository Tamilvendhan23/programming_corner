"The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the first character and then the third character and then the sixth character and so on from the end as the output.Â 
Note: The interval between the printed characters increases by 1 each time.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the characters based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdefghijklmno

Output:
omjfa

Explanation:
The string is abcdefghijklmno.
The first character from the end of the string is o, so o is printed.
The third character from the end of the string is m, the interval between o and m is 1, so m is printed.
The sixth character from the end of the string is j, the interval between m and j is 2, so j is printed.
The tenth character from the end of the string is f, the interval between j and f is 3, so f is printed.
The fifteenth character from the end of the string is a, the interval between f and a is 4, so a is printed.
Hence the output is omjfa

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
northeastwestsouth

Output:
huttt"
