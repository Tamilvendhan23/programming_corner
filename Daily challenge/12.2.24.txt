The program must accept N integers and an integer X. The program must print the count C of multiples of X (which are greater than X) after the first occurrence of X.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000 1 <= X, Each integer value <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains C.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:

6 100
500 100 200 100 600 545

Output: 2
Explanation: 200 and 600 are the multiples. The second 100 is not counted as the multiples must be greater than X.
Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
6 50
500 100 200 100 600 50

Output: 0
