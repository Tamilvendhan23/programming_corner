A table called book is created with the following DDL command:
create table book(id int, name varchar(20), author varchar(20), publishedyear int);
Write the Java code using JDBC APIs to select the name and author for each book whose publishedyear is NOT equal to 2009.
Note:
The order of the columns in the result set must be name and author.
The result set must be ordered by the column name in ascending order.
IMPORTANT:
1. Place your code inside the execute method. You need not code/implement the main method.
2. DO NOT close the Database Connection conn in your code.
