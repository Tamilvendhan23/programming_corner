The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. The program must print the Kth largest integer among the N integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, K <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value  <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the Kth largest integer among the N integers.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9 3
38 92 83 58 78 86 20 92 81
Output:
83
Explanation:
Here N=9 and K=3,
The 1st largest integer is 92.
The 2nd largest integer is 86.
The 3rd largest integer is 83, so 83 is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 4
87 94 91 79 87 87
Output:
79
